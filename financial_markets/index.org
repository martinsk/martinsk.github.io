* Fundamentals

** Ideas:

- Kelly Criteria/Merton Share for sizeing bets
  
\begin{equation}
   l = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2} 
\end{equation}


- Use Markowitz to determine optimal portfolio composition.

\begin{equation}
    r_{(1,2)} = x_1 r_1 + x_2 r_2  \\
    \text{var}(r_{(1,2)}) = \text{var}({r_1}) x_1^2 + \text{var}({r_2}) x_2^2 + 2 x_1 x_2 \text{cov}(r_1, r_2)
\end{equation}


  In general this works for $n$ risky assets with respective normally distributed returns $r_i :  i \in (1..n)$:
\begin{align}
    r_{(1..n)} &= \sum_{i \in (1..n)}{x_i r_i}  \\
    \text{var}(r_{(1..n)}) &=  \sum_{(i,j) \in ((1..n), (1..n))} 2x_ix_j\text{cov}(r_i, r_j) \\
    \sigma(r_{(1..n)}) &= \sqrt{ \sum_{(i,j) \in ((1..n), (1..n))} 2x_ix_j\text{cov}(r_i, r_j)}
\end{align}


-  The above math generatlizes to log normal distributions:
\begin{align}
    r_{(1..n)} &= \sum_{i \in (1..n)}{x_i r_i}  \\
    \text{var}(r_{(1..n)}) &=  \sum_{(i,j) \in ((1..n), (1..n))} 2x_ix_j\text{cov}(r_i, r_j) \\
    \sigma(r_{(1..n)}) &= \sqrt{ \sum_{(i,j) \in ((1..n), (1..n))} 2x_ix_j\text{cov}(r_i, r_j)}
\end{align}

**  Papers
-  RE-Bench: Evaluating frontier AI R&D capabilities of language model
  agents against human experts.  Explains how training AI agents yield
  very interesting performance relative to time spent. In particular
  it looks like human participants deliver exponential increases
  relative to time spent, while AI agents hit a performance wall and
  do not gain improving results as time spent
  increases.  [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15114]]

  Institutions(Harry Markowitz). Yale Class on Optimizing
  portfolio compositions to reduce risk exposure and hence optimizing
  risk return.  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B_24GUWdSM]]

- The Kelly criterion: How to size bets.  A really nice
  interactive representation of the kelly Criterie for determining
  optimal bet sizes when considering a bet with positive expected
  outcome.  [[https://explore.paulbutler.org/bet/]]
  
- Merton's portfolio Problem.  Explains how to use a
  statical approach similar to Kelly, but based on knowledge of the
  statistical distribution in a continuous form.

- Tactical Investment Algorithms(Marcos LÃ³pez de
  Prado).  [Not read] The idea of this paper is to construct a
  properbalistic model of the world, and test strategies against this
  model. We then test the real world against the model to determine if
  we expect our strategies to work.
